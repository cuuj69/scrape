### Description

## Dubizzle

1. First run the webdriver to get the number of results. 
2. Calculate the number of pages with the number of results
3. Using range function, iterate through the range of page numbers
4. Pass the existing code through each iteration


## I have created a results.txt to which all the results will be written to
## This is because the results were too many for our search
